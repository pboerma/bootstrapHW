# Built Creative Responsive Site

- Using Bootstrap, I attempted to make a responsive website.

I created the following files:
 'index.html' 'portfolio.html' 'contact.html' 'stylesheet.css'


   Index.html

This is the home page where I put in a navbar through bootstrap. 
 Each link will take you to the next page

I placed the image and text within a container broken down into separate coloumns

Using the following link code the text and images were made responsive to the size of the screen

added thumbnail feature to create a border appearance

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

Added a link in a new row to link to linkedIn

      Portfolio.html

For my Portfolio I added nature images and also made them with a thumbnail and responsive to different screen sizes

Each link on the navigation bar will take you the other pages

Images were aligned with the size medium


      Contact.html

Created a contact box that will allow the user to input their name, email and message.
This was done using input boxes and created a message box that was flexible so it would adjust to the screen. 

I had some difficulty with the adjustments of the screensize for the contact box as the background would not reamin in line with the text boxes i created.


CSS style sheet

I wanted to style the contact box and the header to make sure I highlight the Name as indicated on images provided
